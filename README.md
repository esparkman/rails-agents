## 🚀 How to Use

### Claude Code Sub-Agents

These agents are designed to work as **Claude Code sub-agents**. Claude Code looks for agent definitions in the `.claude/agents/` directory of your project.

**How it works:**
1. Place agent `.md` files in `.claude/agents/` (or a `commands/` directory)
2. Reference agents using `@agent-name` syntax in Claude Code
3. The agent's instructions, model, and tools are loaded automatically
4. Each agent can analyze and work within your project context

### First Time Setup

1. **Drop the agents into your Rails project**:
   ```bash
   # Create the agents directory if it doesn't exist
   mkdir -p /path/to/your/rails/project/.claude/agents

   # Copy all agent files
   cp *.md /path/to/your/rails/project/.claude/agents/
   ```

2. **On first use, each agent will**:
   - Analyze your codebase patterns
   - Learn your conventions
   - Document what they observe
   - Match your existing style

### Basic Usage

```markdown
# Get architectural guidance
@rails-architect: How should I implement user notifications?

# Implement a model
@rails-model-engineer: Create a Notification model with polymorphic associations

# Build the API
@rails-controller-engineer: Add controller and routes for notifications

# Create the UI
@rails-hotwire-engineer: Build the notification UI with real-time updates

# Write tests
@rails-testing-expert: Write comprehensive tests for notifications

# Security review
@rails-security-performance: Audit the notification system for security issues
```

### Team Workflow

**For a new feature**, follow this workflow:

1. **Architecture** → @rails-architect designs the approach
2. **Data Layer** → @rails-model-engineer implements models
3. **Data Migrations** → @rails-data-migration handles seeds/backfills
4. **Domain Logic** → @rails-domain-logic implements service/form/query objects
5. **API Layer** → @rails-controller-engineer builds controllers
6. **API Serialization** → @rails-api-serializer shapes JSON responses
7. **Frontend** → @rails-hotwire-engineer creates views
8. **Components** → @rails-viewcomponent-engineer builds reusable UI
9. **Accessibility** → @rails-accessibility ensures WCAG compliance
10. **Internationalization** → @rails-i18n adds translations
11. **File Uploads** → @rails-active-storage handles attachments
12. **Email** → @rails-mailer implements notifications (if needed)
13. **Testing** → @rails-testing-expert writes tests
14. **Security/Performance Review** → @rails-security-performance audits
15. **DHH Code Review (mandatory gate)** → @dhh-code-reviewer reviews against Rails-core standards
16. **Deploy** → @rails-deployment handles production release

> Step 15 is a **blocking gate**: any task that produced Ruby, JavaScript, Svelte, or ViewComponent code is not complete until `@dhh-code-reviewer` has run and Critical Issues have been resolved. See global CLAUDE.md ("MANDATORY: DHH Code Review Gate") for the full enforcement rules and the user opt-out language.

### Example: Adding a New Feature

```markdown
## Feature: User Notifications

### Step 1: Architecture
@rails-architect: Design a notification system with:
- Multiple notification types (mention, like, comment)
- Mark as read functionality
- Real-time delivery

### Step 2: Data Layer
@rails-model-engineer: Implement the Notification model based on the architecture

### Step 3: API
@rails-controller-engineer: Create NotificationsController with index, show, mark_read actions

### Step 4: UI
@rails-hotwire-engineer: Build notification dropdown with unread count

### Step 5: Testing
@rails-testing-expert: Write model, controller, and system tests

### Step 6: Review
@rails-security-performance: Audit for N+1 queries and authorization issues
```

## 🧠 How They Learn Your Codebase

On first invocation, each agent:

1. **Reads representative files** from your codebase
2. **Documents patterns** they observe
3. **Matches your style** in all implementations

### What They Learn

- **Rails version** and feature usage
- **Database choice** (PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite)
- **Testing framework** (RSpec vs Minitest)
- **Frontend stack** (Hotwire, React, Vue, traditional)
- **Authentication** (Devise, custom, etc.)
- **Authorization** (Pundit, CanCanCan, custom)
- **Background jobs** (Sidekiq, Resque, Solid Queue)
- **Code organization** (concerns, service objects, etc.)
- **Naming conventions** and code style

## 🤝 Agent Collaboration

Agents naturally work together:

```markdown
# Architect designs → Model implements → Controller exposes →
# Frontend visualizes → Testing validates → Security secures
```

They reference each other:
- "Based on @rails-architect's design..."
- "Following the pattern @rails-model-engineer established..."
- "Coordinating with @rails-controller-engineer on strong parameters..."

## 🔗 Integration with Agent OS

These agents enhance Agent OS workflows:

```markdown
# 1. Create product specs
@.agent-os/instructions/core/create-spec.md

# 2. Get architectural review
@rails-architect: Review the spec and provide technical design

# 3. Implement with the team
@.agent-os/instructions/core/implement-spec.md
(Agents automatically contribute during implementation)

# 4. Test thoroughly
@rails-testing-expert: Ensure comprehensive coverage

# 5. Security audit
@rails-security-performance: Final review before deployment
```

Agents reference:
- `.agent-os/product/overview.md` - Product vision
- `.agent-os/product/roadmap.md` - Feature priorities
- `.agent-os/product/tech-stack.md` - Technology decisions

## 📋 Best Practices

```

### 3. Follow the Workflow

Start with architecture, implement layer by layer, test thoroughly, audit for security.

### 4. Trust the Analysis

On first use, agents analyze your codebase and match your patterns. Trust their recommendations—they're based on what you're already doing.

### 5. Iterate Together

```markdown
@rails-architect: Design user following system
# Review design, provide feedback
@rails-model-engineer: Implement the design from @rails-architect
# Iterate as needed
```

## 🎯 What Makes These Agents Special

## 🔄 Updating & Customizing Agents

### Agent File Structure

Each agent file follows this structure:

```markdown
---
name: agent-name
description: Brief description shown in Claude Code
model: sonnet
tools: Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep,Bash
---

# Agent Title

[Role description and instructions]

## Your First Task: Analyze the Codebase
[Instructions for learning project patterns]

## Core Patterns
[Code examples and best practices]

## Testing Patterns
[Both Minitest and RSpec examples]

## Best Practices
[Do's and Don'ts]

## Integration with Other Agents
[Cross-references to related agents]
```

### Frontmatter Options

| Field | Description | Values |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `name` | Agent identifier (used with `@agent-name`) | kebab-case string |
| `description` | Short description shown in Claude Code UI | String |
| `model` | Claude model to use | `sonnet`, `opus`, `haiku` |
| `tools` | Comma-separated list of allowed tools | `Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep,Bash` |

### Adding Project-Specific Patterns

To add patterns from your own codebase:

1. **Identify the pattern** in your codebase
2. **Extract a minimal example** that demonstrates the pattern
3. **Add it to the relevant agent** under "Advanced Patterns" or create a new section
4. **Include both test frameworks** (Minitest and RSpec) when applicable

Example addition to `rails-model-engineer.md`:

```markdown
## Your Project's Patterns

### Soft Delete Pattern

Your codebase uses soft deletes via `discarded_at`:

\`\`\`ruby
# app/models/concerns/discardable.rb
module Discardable
  extend ActiveSupport::Concern

  included do
    scope :kept, -> { where(discarded_at: nil) }
    scope :discarded, -> { where.not(discarded_at: nil) }
  end

  def discard
    update!(discarded_at: Time.current)
  end

  def kept?
    discarded_at.nil?
  end
end
\`\`\`

Always use this pattern instead of `dependent: :destroy` for user-facing records.
```

### Creating a New Agent

1. **Create a new markdown file** in the agents directory:
   ```bash
   touch rails-your-specialty.md
   ```

2. **Add the frontmatter**:
   ```markdown
   ---
   name: rails-your-specialty
   description: Your Specialty Expert - brief description
   model: sonnet
   tools: Read,Write,Edit,Glob,Grep,Bash
   ---
   ```

3. **Include these sections**:
   - Role description
   - "Your First Task: Analyze the Codebase" section
   - Core patterns with code examples
   - Testing patterns (both Minitest and RSpec)
   - Best practices (Do's and Don'ts)
   - Integration with other agents

4. **Update README.md** to include your new agent

### Enhancing Agents from Your Codebase

Use Claude Code to help analyze your codebase and extract patterns:

```markdown
@claude Analyze our app/models/concerns/ directory and identify patterns
that should be added to rails-model-engineer.md. Format them as code
examples with explanations.
```

```markdown
@claude Review our app/jobs/ directory and suggest additions to
rails-background-jobs.md based on our job patterns.
```

### Best Practices for Agent Updates

**Do:**
- Keep examples minimal and focused
- Include both Minitest and RSpec examples for testing patterns
- Add "Use When" guidance for new patterns
- Cross-reference related agents
- Match the existing formatting style
- Test patterns in your actual codebase first

**Don't:**
- Add overly complex examples
- Include sensitive/proprietary code
- Remove existing patterns (add alongside them)
- Forget to update the "Integration with Other Agents" section
- Skip the "Your First Task" analysis instructions

### Keeping Agents in Sync

When your codebase evolves:

1. **Periodic review**: Review agents quarterly against your codebase
2. **Pattern extraction**: When you solve something novel, add it to the relevant agent
3. **Deprecation notes**: Mark outdated patterns as deprecated rather than removing
4. **Version notes**: Consider adding a changelog section for major updates

```markdown
## Changelog

### 2024-01
- Added soft delete pattern from Project X
- Updated authentication to use magic links
- Deprecated Devise patterns (migrated to custom auth)
```

## ❓ Questions & Troubleshooting

**Q: Do I need all agents?**
A: No! Use the ones you need. They work independently or together.

**Q: What if my project uses RSpec instead of Minitest?**
A: The testing agent analyzes your `spec/` directory and adapts automatically.

**Q: Can I customize the agents?**
A: Yes! Edit the agent files to add project-specific patterns or guidelines.

**Q: Do they work with Rails API-only apps?**
A: Yes! They adapt to your Rails configuration and won't suggest view code if you don't have views.

**Q: What about monolithic vs modular Rails apps?**
A: They analyze your structure and follow your organization patterns.
